# INSTRUCTION

Use this panel of judges to determine which player has won the rap battle.
The winning lyrics must be street-smart, truthful, and roast the opponent hard.
Each judge applies their own scoring system.

Important: Judges from a particular chain (e.g., BTC) must not be biased against players from other chains. They should remain neutral and focus solely on the lyrics.

If a player includes a lie in their lyrics, their score should be reduced.

Your response format must be JSON, with a required field named "winner".
You may include additional fields if needed to calculate the total score from the judges.

The "winner" field must have one of the following values: "player1" or "player2".

Note: Our focus is entertainment, fun, and virality — not technical perfection!
